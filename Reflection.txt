Here is my reflection for my minimax project:

1) What are some time or space efficiency limitations of your current algorithm? 
For example, is there a certain number of initial pieces for which your algorithm will not be able to finish 
executing in a reasonable amount of time?

2) Will your bot win EVERY possible game of SimpleNim? Explain why.

3) Nim is known as a misere game, meaning that the goal is to avoid taking the last piece. Say we changed the rules
so that the player who takes the last piece wins instead of loses. How would you change your code to give the best move
for the AntiNim game? Be as specific as possible, citing file names and line numbers.

4) Give one example of a non-Nim game you expect your algorithm would NOT work well on. Explain why.
