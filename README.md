# Minimax

Background and motivation
- Nim is a game a two player zero sum game (where when one player wins, the other loses) where each player takes turns taking however many pieces they want from one of three possible piles. The objective of the game is to not take the last piece and you are only allowed to take from one pile per turn. We started by coding SimpleNim, a simpler version of the nim game that only contains one pile and limits each player's turn to taking between 1 and 3 pieces. We coded a function to tell us what the best move would be given our options (taking 1, 2, or 3 pieces) and in order to do this, we needed to recursively trace through game trees for our possible options given whether it is player 1's turn or player 2's turn and how many chips were left on the board. Minimax is the function we coded to determine what was a "good" move by using information about who was playing to score each move (with 1 being a good move and -1 being a bad one for player 1)- this depended on who's turn it is because for example, if there are 3 chips left on the board and it is player 1's turn, the best move for player 1 is to take 2 chips because it forces player 2 to take the last chip. Therefore, the score for taking 2 chips is good for player 1 and bad for player 2- this is because the game is zero-sum (meaning when one player wins the other loses) Nim is a good test case for this algorithm because it is zero sum (so there is no degree of winning and ties are not possible) and because it is easy to identify the numerical values for the amount of chips to take (as opposed to chess or tic tac toe which is not as much of a number game or can be tied).

Usage
- Someone can run my program by running runGame for NimRunner or for RealNim in a Tester class and calling the files NimRunner and RealNim. You can do so by running printing NimRunner.runGame(#) with # equal to the number of pieces starting on the table or printing RealNim.runGame(). THe only files required to run the program are the NimRunner file where I have coded the logic that creates a functioning nim game and a tester file or another file to run the actual game. (You could also run the game within the main function fo the NimRunner class)

Future directions
- Some improvements that can be made to my code is that currently, I accept the first "good move" that I come across in my code when in reality there are probably other good moves that we haven't seen yet and we don't take into account the degree to which a move is "good" so if I had more time on this project I would try to grade good moves by degree of success likely and then choose the true best move. For real nim, I would also include the possibility to change who gets to play first like flipping a coin and I would add the ability to choose the starting number of piles and how many chips are in each pile as opposed to just creating a random starter table (with a random number of piles and chips in each pile)
